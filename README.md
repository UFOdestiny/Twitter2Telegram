# Twitter2Telegram

This project can fetch images from Twitter and send them to Telegram.

Various charming users post infinite interesting images. However, my application for Twitter api got rejected...

I've strained every nerve to scrape Twitter using python only, but I failed...

Well, finally I use javascript to get images dynamically, then I deploy an api server to receive the images and send
them to Telegram.
